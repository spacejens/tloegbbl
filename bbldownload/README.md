## Description

This small module downloads the whole contents of a previous software solution, based on [Aros Blood Bowl League](https://www.aros.bbleague.net), that we used for our book-keeping, so [bblimport](../bblimport) can transform it and send it to the [backend](../backend).

Since this download was a one-time operation, this script might no longer perform as expected if used at a future date.
